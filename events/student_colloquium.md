# Student Colloquium

Student Colloquium has a rich history in CSGSA but I will only include recent history as that is what I know best.

## Spring 2024

Due to reports of low attendance in Fall 2023, we attempted to revamp the format of student colloquium. Instead of a weekly or biweekly format, we decided to hold two events:
1. A longer, more traditional event with multiple speakers
2. A reserach project matching event which was fair style and aimed to match PhD students/faculty with masters students seeking independent study.

The first event was very poorly attended. It is unclear if this is due to inadequate advertisement or lack of interest.

The second event went generally well, so I will give details hers:
* Location: Held in DLC 1B70, with snack in DLC 1B68 (across the hall, booked separately)
* Funding: Department
* Duration: 2-3 hours
* Food: Fruit, cookies, tea, coffee, chips, etc.
* Format:
  * Some tables with PhD students/faculty advertising projects (front half of the room)
  * Some tables for peer advice, with masters students who have successfully completed independent study courses
* Planning notes
  * To be successful, should be mid- or early- semester when students are still seeking independent study placements
  * Most difficult part is recruiting faculty/PhD stduents/labs seeking masters students. Word of mouth worked best or individual slack messages
