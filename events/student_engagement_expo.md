# Student Engagement Expo

## Spring 2024

This event was held for the first time in Spring 2024, and was regarded as a success (although it could be improved in future years). 
It was a joint effort between CS-GSA and CS_GPDC and student representatives.

* **Purpose:** The purpose of this event was to gather interest in students who will return the next fall about student leadership and department involvement
* **Format:**
  * Welcome by department staff
  * Presentation with an overview on opportunities for engagement and volunteering in the department, given by students in various organizations
  * Dinner with current leadership interspersed at various tables
  * QR codes at all times for form to collect student interest for follow-up
* **Scheduling:** Scheduled before elections for the next year; attendees should NOT include students who are graduating or otherwise ineligible for department leadership positions the next fall.
* **Recruitment:**
*   * Must recruit current leadership for attendance and for making the overview presentation
    * Must recruit attendees; mostly from masters students - can use introductory classes as a way to make announcement for this
