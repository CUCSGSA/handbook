## How to Plan An Event

### Checklist

So you want to plan an event! Excellent! Here is a general checklist:

- [ ] Appoint a `point person` and a `backup point person`. These people will be responsible for completing this checklist through **delegation**
      Ideally, both people would be physically present before the event (setup), during the event, and after the event (teardown)
- [ ] Articulate the purpose of the event
- [ ] Formalize the plan for funding
- [ ] Decide on a date (may be dependent on venue). Deconflict with department staff and other student clubs (CS-GPDC)
- [ ] Book venue (should be done in conjunction with 
- [ ] Acquire the funding; change plans if funding is different than anticipated
- [ ] Order food (well in advance, at least TWO WEEKS) - may depend on RSVPs. The timeline for ordering food depends on both funding source and source of the food.
- [ ] Advertise the event at least TWO WEEK IN ADVANCE. Publicity should use multiple modalities including word of mouth, slack, AND email.
      Collect RSVPs
- [ ] Advertise the event THE WEEK OF. Publicity should use multiple modalities including word of mouth, slack, AND email.

### General Event Planning Philosophy
  * Less can be more. Sometimes two events per semester can have better attendance than the aggregate of a weekly event throughout the entire semester.
  * If an event has previously been held, and has had issues with attendence, the event should be critically examined to see if holding the event again is a good use of CSGSA resources. Let's learn from the past!
  * Planning all events at the beginning of the year is the best way to ensure events are sprinkled evenly throughout the year and to avoid schedule conflicts.
  * Do NOT promise anyone anything (swag, food, etc.) unless you already have it ordered.
  * Word of mouth can be the most effective way to promote events.
  * When planning an event, make sure to ask yourself, "What does this event provide that other events on campus do not already provide?"

### General Advice on Logistics
* **Zoom:** Using breakout rooms can be more successful than using multiple zoom meetings for events such as mock interviews
* **Name Tags:** Name tags for attendees is a recommendation to promote community. If inviting staff/faculty/people from outside, have their names printed. Otherwise sticky tags are enough
* **Room reservations:**
  * DLC1B70 is what you would use for most events. **If using DLC, make sure all the tables are clean and aligned properly and in the correct places otherwise you will have to pay a fine.**
  * Should be available in EMS(ems.colorado.edu) under Staff/faculty no recursive events.
  * Other alternatives depending on the situation can include KITTEREDGE central (this room is paid and we use this only for large events w/ speakers)
  * ATLAS 100 is a nice room (similar option is ECCR 265).
  * Some other potential places that we didn’t explore as much: BOLD center, Idea Forge. You can book rooms through ems.colorado.edu
* **Storage:** Items for events may be stored in CS staff offices; ask for permission and make sure you will be able to get into the office at the correct time on the day of the event. 
* **Food orders:** make sure you decide and order food for the event at least 2 weeks in advance. If you are using Dept funding, Nicole can place the order for you, and you just need to make sure you get the receipt and keep it safe. If using CSI, same process, CSI will order for you, and you keep and upload the receipt to them. If you’re ordering food for events(mock interviews, P2P), make sure to place orders at least 3 weeks - 1 months in advance.
* **RSVP:** If you are sending out RSVPs, send out to listserv, ask someone for a list of the servs.
* **Swag:**
  * If you are using the CU logo, you have to get approval from strategic relations.
  * If you are using just the GPDC or CSGSA logo, you need not get approval. CSGSA has some approved designs in a private repo [here](https://github.com/CUCSGSA/designs)
  * 4imprints is a nice vendor for this stuff.
  * While ordering swag, keep in mind that bulk orders are cheaper.
  * We have ordered cheap Hanes shirts in the past, but they were so rough to wear it caused discomfort for some students. It's recommended to pay more for a higher quality tshirt. Also make sure to buy shirts in a range of sizes.
