# Orientation Week

CSGSA plays a vital role in welcoming new graduate students to the CU Boulder community through a series of orientation events. This handbook provides a comprehensive guide for future CSGSA chairs and volunteers, outlining responsibilities, event details, and best practices to ensure a successful and smooth orientation week.


CSGSA is responsible for organizing key events such as student-led modules, campus and engineering center tours, a scavenger hunt, the department lunch, and the international student social. Additionally, CSGSA presents at various orientation sessions and coordinates a student-led hike, which is detailed in a separate document.


**Important Note**( The CS department typically handles funding, food orders, and room bookings, so CSGSA does not need to worry about these aspects. This is one event we don’t have to have to book rooms for or order food for. Ensure all volunteers and CSGSA execs are available and in town for orientation week, as it’s common for people to travel during the break before the fall semester.)


# Events Organized by CSGSA:

* Student-Led Modules
* Scavenger Hunt
* Helping with Department Lunch
* Helping with International Student Social
* Presentations at Various Orientations (PhD, MSCS, MSCPS, NE, etc.)
* Campus and Engineering Center Tours
* Student-Led Hike 

# Responsibilities Overview:

## Volunteer Coordination:
Ensure the Graduate Program Manager sends out a volunteer request form for all of the events. If not, CSGSA must take the initiative to recruit volunteers for all events.
CSGSA is responsible for coordinating volunteers and managing setup and teardown for almost all events.


## Communication & RSVPs:
Send out separate RSVPs and calendar invites for each event, clearly outlining expectations and responsibilities.
Two stages of communication:
Initial Details: Send out time expectations, event overview, and any specific requirements a few weeks or a week in advance.
Final Details: Provide finer details (e.g., exact times, locations, specific duties) the day before the event.
For each event, include specific instructions, and provide comprehensive information.
This could include everything from when and where the volunteers arrive,  


# Event-Specific Guidelines:
### **1. Department Lunch**:
  * **Coordination**: Work closely with volunteers to ensure all tasks are covered.
  * **Setup & Teardown**: CSGSA is responsible for the setup and teardown of the event. This includes arranging tables, chairs, and any other required materials.
  * **During the Event**: Assist with anything needed, such as guiding students, managing queues, or facilitating conversations among attendees.


### **2. International Student Social**:
  * **Coordination**: Similar to the department lunch, coordinate with volunteers for setup and teardown.
  * **Duties**: Typically involves tasks such as swiping Buff Cards, managing attendee lists, and offering general assistance to ensure the event runs smoothly.


### **3. CSGSA Presentation**:
  * Emphasize the **bouldercsgrads.org** website as a vital resource for new students and point out the most important information like the course review page and upcoming events pages.
  * Discuss upcoming events for the semester, including social and professional development opportunities.
  * Introduce the grad student Slack, Tea Time, and other recurring events to encourage participation and engagement.


### **4. Student-Led Modules**:
  * **Participation Format**: In-person sessions have historically had better turnout than remote ones.(3-5 students on zoom as opposed to 70-80 students in person.)
  * **Session Structure**: Aim for 5-7 sessions, each lasting 20-40 minutes, spread over 90 minutes per day (e.g., 3 sessions of 30 minutes each).
  * **Informal Atmosphere**: Keep the sessions informal, as this format has been well-received by students in the past.
  * **Topic Examples**: Navigating the PhD, Navigating MS, Financial Basics, Living in Boulder, Being an International Student, Advising Relationships, Outdoor Access.
  * **Preparation**: Slides for these sessions are available on CSGSA’s OneDrive. Share them with presenters a few weeks in advance, allowing time for customization.


### **5. Campus and Engineering Center Tours:**
  * **Route Planning**: To avoid large groups, plan multiple routes (e.g., clockwise and counterclockwise).
  * **Key Talking Points**:
    * DLC (Discovery Learning Center): Venue for CS department events, occasional classes, HCI labs, and the Colorado Space Grant Consortium.
    * ITLL (Integrated Teaching and Learning Laboratory): A hub for creative work, offering 3D printers, laser cutters, workshops, and more. Training is required to use the equipment.
    * Engineering Lobby (ENGR): A popular spot for relaxing or having lunch, with Violet Peaks Café and the Dean’s Office nearby.
    * ECCS & ECCR: Classroom buildings that may be tricky to navigate at first, but signs in the hallways help guide you.
    * CSEL (Computer Science Education Lab): A commons area for undergrads, where TAs hold office hours and students can study.
    * Robotics Labs: Home to robotics research, where you’ll often see robotic dogs in action.
    * ECOT 7th Floor: Offices for advisors and faculty, as well as the CS front office. Students will frequently visit this floor for advising sessions.
    * Farrand Field: One of the most photographed spots on campus—encourage students to take pictures here.
    * Wardenburg Health Center: Offers a range of services, including nap pods, wellness suites, and lower-cost medical and mental health services.
    * C4C (Center for Community): Houses various student services, including Career Services, Disability Services, and the BuffOneCard office.
    * Norlin Library: A historic study spot with a rich history tied to George Norlin, CU’s 5th president.
    * UMC (University Memorial Center): Features food options, study spaces, bowling, and billiards.
    * Folsom Field: Home to CU’s football team, with a statue of Ralphie the Buffalo—great for photo opportunities.


### **6. Scavenger Hunt**:
  * The scavenger hunt is designed to help new students explore the campus and figure out where everything is.
  * **Planning the Event**:
    * **Volunteers**: Recruit at least 10 volunteers to guide the teams. Aim for at least 8-10 teams.
    * **Team Structure**: Teams should be no larger than 6-8 students plus a group leader (volunteer).
    * **Prizes**: Swag will be given to the winning team at the end of the event.
    * **Team Assignment**: Split participants into teams on the spot, as RSVPs may not always be reliable.
    * **Clues and Navigation**: Each group leader will have a set of clues designed to guide their team around campus in a specific order. The leader will hand out clues, guide the team to the locations, and provide hints as needed. Feel free to share interesting facts about each location.
    * **Communication**: Communicate with volunteers before the event, asking them to arrive early. Expectations and details should be sent out in advance to both volunteers and participants.
    * **Resources**: The hints used in previous scavenger hunts can be found in the CSGSA’s OneDrive.


### **7. Student-Led Hike**:
  * We have started taking new students on a hike at the end of orientation for some fun and time away from classrooms. Here are a few key points to keep in mind:
    * Consideration for New Students: Many incoming students are not accustomed to the elevation or the dry climate of Boulder, so they may tire easily during the hike.
    * It is mandatory that all participants bring water. If they do not have water, they should not be allowed to join the hike.(this could be a way to ensure that they bring water on the hike and not be dehydrated.)
    * Emphasize the importance of sun protection, as the sun can be particularly harsh at this elevation.
  * **Risk Management**: Since this is an outdoor event with inherent risks, it is crucial to print and have students sign a risk waiver before the hike. The waiver can be found on CU’s website and is absolutely mandatory to avoid liability in case of any incidents.
  * **Alternative Activity**: Consider organizing a parallel board game event for less fit or physically challenged students who may not be able to participate in the hike. This can be a challenge, as most rooms are reserved for undergraduate orientation activities on the Friday of orientation week, but it's worth exploring as an inclusive option.


## Final Notes:
Be proactive in your planning and communication to ensure that all aspects of orientation are covered. This is a pivotal time for incoming students, and a well-executed orientation will set a positive tone for their experience at CU Boulder.

## **_Have a wonderful orientation week!!_**
