# CSI Funding

This document will serve as a broad introduction and overview of requesting and utilizing funding from the Center for Student Involvement (CSI) as a CSGSA Treasurer.

## Request Types
Before submitting a funding request, it is important to distinguish between the different categories of funding. Generally, there are two funding types:
* Event
    * Large scale events
    * Must be publicized to the entire CU Boulder campus (cannot use this for departmental events)
    * Not required that students from many different departments attend - it just needs to be advertised to everyone
* Operational
    * Smaller-scale events - can be advertised only to your specific department if desired
    * Funding for items/services required for the day-to-day operation of your RSO

## Funding Restrictions
Different funding boards will have different restrictions on the amount of funding they will provide, as well as what the funding can be used for. This document will address two boards: University of Colorado Engineering Council (UCEC) and Student Organization Allocations Committee (SOAC). There are other committees; however, in all likelihood you will primarily be requesting from SOAC. More info on these below:
* UCEC (as of February 2024)
    * Up to $600 may be requested per semester
* SOAC (as of August 2024)
    * Can request up to $3,000 per year
    * Does not carry over if full $3,000 is not requested in a given year
    * $1,000 cap for travel
    * $1,000 cap for operational food (for entire year)
    * $2,000 cap for event food (for entire year)
    * For travel funding information, speak to your liaison
    * Event and travel requests must be submitted a minimum of 30 days in advance
    * Operational funding requests can be submitted with less notice


## Requesting Funds
CSI will have an appointed liaison for your RSO. The first step - especially as a new treasurer - is to meet with your liaison ahead of requesting funding. This document will serve as a supplemtary document for that meeting but should not replace it entirely. Your liaison is responsible for sending your funding request through to your requested CSI board - i.e., they will be the first person to approve/deny your request. Please do not treat this document as fully up to date, as requirements can change year by year. As such, please meet with your liaison before submitting any requests. In order to make a request for your CSI liaison to view:
* On BuffConnect, select "Groups"
* Select your RSO
* Select "Accounting Book"
* Select "Student Org Funding Request"
* Fill out your request - be very specific in the "Notes" sections
* Upload attachments and screenshots - evidence for how you arrived at your estimate

Once your funding request is submitted, your liaison will decide which funding board is appropriate to forward it to. Keep in mind that if you're specifically seeking funding from UCEC, you must specify this as part of your request title.

## Hearings (SOAC)
SOAC requires hearings as part of the approval process. Once your request has been sent by your liaison and pre-approved in BuffConnect by your committee, the committee will reach out to you via email about scheduling a hearing. The hearing should entail a roughly 15 minute presentation by the treasurer (other members of the org can come if they wish), with 5 minutes devoted to the organization and its mission, 5 minutes devoted to the request itself, and 5 minutes for questions. Be sure to be specific and give estimates when discussing the request. If your request is approved after the hearing, the committee will reach out via email.

## Pre-Spending Meeting
Once your request is fully approved, you will be required to attend a pre-spending meeting with a member of CSI's finance team. You will not be allowed to spend your funds until this meeting is complete. Once the request is approved, a CSI representative will reach out to you via email to schedule your pre-spending meeting

## Spending the Funds
Once you've completed your pre-spending meeting, your funds will be available for use in BuffConnect. You cannot access these funds directly - your CSI finance representative will be responsible for placing orders on your behalf using the funding you've been granted. As such, be sure to maintain a constant line of communication regarding your specific event dates and requested orders with your finance representative. They will be your primary point of contact regarding order status and delivery dates, among other things. You will see updates in BuffConnect regarding your remaining balance. Be sure to discuss specifics - such as tipping and tax exemptions - with your finance representative.

## Post-Spending Report
Now that you've spent all of your funds, it's time to fill out your post-spending report. This is a requirement in order for your RSO to remain in good standing with CSI. Failure to do so may result in a denial for future funding requests. The form essentially serves as a summary for your spending activities across your events, and addresses any remaining balances. The form and more specific instructions can be found in BuffConnect.
