TODO: Write about good practices for elections and voting.
There are two stages to setting up an election:
- Candidates self-nominate themselves for positions (form has to stay open for two weeks)
- Then we run the actual election amongst those candidates (form has to stay open for one week)

Self-nomination
- Ask for degree type
- Ask for why they’re running, what they’re interested in, etc.
- It’s alright to have these results public to the CSGSA out of the gate
- When looking at results before opening up the election, consider whether people have been active, have applied to multiple positions, etc.
    - It’s alright to reach out to folks in an attempt to ensure that their interest is legitimate, and to ensure that they know what they’re signing up for
- We’ve opened up elections for 1st year students in this upcoming cycle, TBD how that goes (TODO: update this doc with findings from thatprocess)

Actual election
- Create a form where each question relates to the position that is vacant, and the options are the potential candidates
- THIS FORM IS HANDLED BY A THIRD PARTY
    - Emails are required to be collected on this form to verify that votes are legitimate (i.e. from currently enrolled students) -> this third party can check with Rajshree to verify votes
    - Once the votes are verified, results are sent to the CSGSA WITHOUT any names or emails attached
- Election votes are then tallied and publicized
